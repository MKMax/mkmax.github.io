        <h1> Hey! </h1>
        <p>
            Welcome to my humble website. I'm Maxim (or Max), a highschool student,
            and a math and programming enthusiast. I experiment a lot with all sorts of stuff
            including, but not limited to: Graphics, Multi-Threading, Networking, and just
            now web development.
        </p>
        <p>
            Now... I thought my list of achievements was going to be impressive, but
            all it boils down to is just experimenting and learning. But, you can still
            visit my <a class="link" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/MKMax"> Github Profile</a>
            and check out what I may have on there. As of now, I haven't
            made much besides a few personal apps. However, with the creation of this
            website, and the start of my next school year, I'm hoping to improve this. In fact,
            I have a few projects pending that are planned to be released to the public
            some time in the future!
        </p>
        <p>
            I also thought I would tag on a 
            <a class="link" href="blog/index.html"> blog</a> about programming onto here for anyone
            interested.
        </p>
        <p>
            This website is also coded entirely by hand with no scripts or backend applications.
            It's a pain to manage.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p> Anyways, see you around! </p>
